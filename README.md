# kinda-vdom-exploration
This is an exploration in creating an easy to use kind of Virtual DOM library.

## Goals
* Our motto is "Just drop it in with a script tag and be done with it"
* Make it fun not to need a compile step when using the library
* Be fast enough for real world usage
* Must support server side rendering
* Must be compatible with IE11
* Should be minimal
